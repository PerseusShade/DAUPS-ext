## Description

This is the README for the **DAUPS** extension, which provides support for the custom language **daups** ‚Äî a simple, pseudocode-like language used for teaching and experimenting with algorithmic concepts.

## üì¶ Extension Information

This Visual Studio Code extension includes:

- Syntax highlighting for **daups** code.
- Hover information for functions and variables.
- Code completion for keywords and user-defined symbols.
- Inline decorations and diagnostics.
- Script execution via an embedded Python-based interpreter.

Documentation of the **daups** language: [https://perseusshade.github.io/DAUPS-docs/EN.html](https://perseusshade.github.io/DAUPS-docs/EN.html)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

You must have **Python 3.x** installed. The execution of `daups` scripts relies on a Python interpreter included with the extension.

To check your Python version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If not installed, download it from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## üîß Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `daups.enableUnusedVariableHighlight`: Enable/disable highlighting of unused variables (default: `true`)
- `daups.pythonInterpreterPath`: Path to the Python interpreter (optional, default: `python3`)
- `daups.showExecutionOutput`: Automatically display the output panel after script execution (default: `true`)

## üêû Known Issues

- No real-time type error checking is currently implemented.
- Some errors might not be handled properly.
- Occasional issues may arise when running `daups` files.
- Minor inconsistencies may exist in how the language is interpreted.

## üì¶ Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the **DAUPS** extension.

## üë§ About the Author

This extension was developed by a student as a personal project during free time. It aims to help learners of algorithmic thinking by making pseudocode more interactive and accessible within a modern code editor like Visual Studio Code.
